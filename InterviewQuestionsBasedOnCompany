    1. what is threads
    2. serialization
    3. synchronization
    4. how can we run a appliaction in a thread
    5. volatile usage
    6. transient
    7. generics
    6. have 2 functions of arg Student , Subject . Which will call if functin(null);
    7. what is data structures
    8. what is dbms
    9. how to create a custom annotation (restriction that have on annotation creation)
    10. what are the interfaces and class in collections . And what is the internal interfaces that have inside each collection.
    11. test cases and exception handling
    12. How can we extend the subclass of the class(generics)
        <T extends A> it will allow A too
        <? extends A> it will only allow the subtype of A.
    13. Primitive , wrapper deep knowledge.

    Coding:
    1. reverese a number without using a inbuilt functions
    2. fibbonaci series
    3. a ball if falling from height =11 , and continously falling for half height and stop to 0. 
        calculate the distance that ball travesed.
    4. static block added for already written code.
    5. primitive class creation and inserting a string created through that in set. what happens and what will the size of set if inserting same name in set using that wrapper class.

TECH ROUND -1
-------------

store in same list , no need to take the other list 
List<String> stringList = new ArrayList<>{"bharath","meena"};

stringList.stream().reverse().map(str -> new StringBuilder(str).reverse()).forEach(System::println); -- wrong 

json , how will you map this using object as well the json
["school":{
 "id":1,
 "name":"xyz",
  "sudents":[{
	"id":11,
	"name":"meena"
},{
	"id":12,
	"name":"ashoka"
}]
}
]

Map<School,List<Student>> = one is map ,what is the another approach. 

SQL query:
student_name , total_marks
99 - 2(1st rank)
98 - 4(2nd rank)
96 - 3rd rank 
97 
6ranks 

select student_name from students s order by s.total_marks desc 
					group by s.total_marks limit 1 offset 3

said on inner and outer query.

radix sort , where it is used. 
121 , 10 ,2 
turns = 3

django,
git commands
    How can I get the particular commit by the message
    what is squash
hash algorithm 
mongodb
sendrequest , forward.
spring boot (2)
dependency injection 
what is auto configuration , can we able to off the auto configuration?
diff b/w linked and doubly linked list , said all what are other diff?
why we need linked list?
why is array vs linked list?. 
unix commands - directory 
can able have web application in spring?
how should I get all the method names in a class in java?
    import java.lang.reflect.Method;
    Class<?> clazz = MyClass.class;
    // Get all declared methods of the class
     Method[] methods = clazz.getDeclaredMethods();


Peer Island

1. List all the adjacent subsets 
    E.g. : 3 7 4 6 5, Our possible subsets are [3,4,5] , [3,4], [3,6] , [3,5], [7,6],[7,5] and [4,5]
2. Write a function, that will print out all prime numbers in a given string.
        Ex. "abc2134kd31" will output an array [2,13,3,3,31] (in the order they appear in the string).
3. SQL 
    Student [id, name, class]
    Subject [id, name, class, price]
    Find the total cost for student.
    Student:
    1 S1 1
    2 S2 1
    3 S3 2
    Subject:
    1 Math 1 10
    2 Science 1 15
    3 Math 2 20
    4 Science 2 25
    Output should be:
    s1 25
    s2 25
    s3 45
    Along with asked what if i didn't use group by here .
4. Spring mvc controller anotations
5. What is solid principles
6. Design patterns
7. overloading, overriding.

qsn which is not known 
1. what are the memories in java have
2. what if exception occurs in finally block 
    the exception that thrown in try block get overridden by exception in finally block, to get the
    try block expection we can use suppressException 
3. what is the types of lock we have?
    object & class lock 
4. others are basic question in spring and oops 
5. what is class loader in java?
    onRequest from JVM loads the the class. 
6. coding
    occurance of word in string 
    duplicate chars in the string

m2p 

1. why spring 
2. What is DI 
3. layers in application 
4. coding   
    balanced paranthesis 
    sorted array and merge 2 arrays and sort that too

And indepth questions in hiberate 
array = [2,3,6,1,10,15,12,]
TargetSum = 10
find the two integers which equals this TargetSum..

Way to do  [2 SUM]
---------
Define a set 
iterate the array
find the difference target adn iterated num.
check whether it's in set.
if yes, return difference and num
if no, add the num in to set.
